## Background
Well before starting Coder Academy's full-stack web development bootcamp, I took a front-web class at Academy Xi and built a mock e-commerce landing page.

It was a fun introduction to paired programming, HTML & CSS (Bootstrap), and marks the time in my life when I began to dip my toes into the world of digital and development, found the water was warm and haven't looked back.

As the completionist in me hates to leave things unfinished and not quite right, it was fun to go back and tidy this up, and think about how far I've come since then.
